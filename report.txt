--> I have first done the data cleaning, which will produce a dataframe, having diseases and their symptoms in the form of 1s and 0s, 
	where, 1 representing that the particular symptom is present in that particular disease and 0 representing the opposite.
--> Then, I have made a decision tree(using the concepts of information gain and entropy) for the whole dataset, interactively, i.e., 
	the decision tree gets updated after every query from the user.
-->Then, I have made a PYWEBIO application using the same python code in my local machine(code is in main.py).
-->I have also attached a working example screenshot of the app.
